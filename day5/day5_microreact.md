#Using Data-Flo and MicroReact 

##Metadata
We can have a shared google sheet for adding information on our sequences

Check out this one as an example:

##Data-Flo

Data flow is a tool to process data and output a useful format. It's a modular tool, allowing users to click and drag boxes rather than use code. This data-flo takes the google sheet we just used, processes it, and creates a microreact. 

If you edited the microreact to have views and different charts, you would want to use the 'update microreact' option as the last module, rather than 'create microreact' to make sure the data is visualised the way you want each time you update the data. 

Click 'run' and then click the url produced to see the microreact. 

To see the modules and how the data is processed, click the pencil (edit) icon at the top.

##Microreact

Microreact is a great interactive visualisation tool. It can go down very well with presentations to stakeholders! You can add all sorts of metadata, sequence data and even trees to your visualisations. Check out this one to visualise all the sequence data from Tanzania:
